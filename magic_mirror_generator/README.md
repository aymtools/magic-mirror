Provides [Dart Build System](https://github.com/dart-lang/build) builders for handling Class-Information.

The builders generate code when they find members annotated with classes defined
in [package:magic_mirror](https://pub.dev/packages/magic_mirror).

- To generate to/from Class-Information code for a class, annotate it with
  `@MReflectionEnable`. You can provide arguments to `@MReflectionEnable` to configure the generated code.
